IDEaS Summer Skills Workshop 2017
=================================

Welcome to the Insitute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS) Summer Skills
Workshop 2017!

This workshop will attempt to engage graduate students and postdocs in the
comptational sciences, natural sciences, and engineering disciplines to provide
an introduction to scientific computing and programming with emphasis on the
following topics:

* Programming in Python
* Numerical Linear Algebra
* Databases
* Machine Learning
* High-Performance Computing

This workshop will consist of a one-hour lecture each week by a faculty member
covering one of the above topics (one lecture per topic), where a weekly
project meant to acquaint participants with the topic will be assigned.  This
lecture will then be followed by a hands-on session in which the project and
any necessary skills will be discussed, and any questions addressed.  This
repository is meant to accompany these hands-on sessions and projects, as well
as introducing workshop participants with the principles of social coding.
