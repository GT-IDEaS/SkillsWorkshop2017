Problem 03: Largest Prime Factor
================================

Please write a short Python program to solve Problem 03: Largest Prime Factor.
Your script should be named `firstinitiallastname_03.py` (e.g.,
`dsirianni_03.py`), to reduce possible conflicts between everyone's solutions.
Once you have confirmed your solution [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3), 
please commit your changes and open a pull request from your fork to 
[upstream](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/SkillsWorkshop2017), just like in our
