Week 01: Introduction to Python
===============================

This week, our focus is to introduce the Python programming language and a few
tools that we'll be using throughout this course.  Our first project will be to
complete the first five problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/),
with the following goals:

* Acquaint students with solving problems using Python, 
* Learn & practice social coding principles with GitHub, and
* Write a short (around one paragraph) "journal" describing your approach to
and challenges faced during this project using LaTeX.

To get started, [sign up](https://projecteuler.net/register) for an account with 
Project Euler, and try the first two problems.  We will discuss the solutions to
these problems, as well as the potential challenges for the next three problems,
during the hands-on session on Thursday, July 20th.
