Problem 01: Multiples of 3 and 5
================================

Please write a short Python program to solve Problem 01: Multiples of 3 and 5.
Your script should be named `firstinitiallastname_01.py` (e.g.,
`dsirianni_01.py`), to reduce possible conflicts between everyone's solutions.
Once you have confirmed your solution [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1), 
please commit your changes and open a pull request from your fork to 
[upstream](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/SkillsWorkshop2017), just like in our
hands-on exercise with the [planets](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/planets) repository.
